# Todo CLI

A todo list cli app created using Go. (to understand Go ofcourse)

## go build

use this command to build an executable

## ./main.exe

You can run the exec with the above command on windows

I've added the cli commands as specified in the [roadmaps.sh project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

Update: I realise this is very barebones as I don't have much experience with Go, I saw another submission that used cobra & lipgloss to create a more visually efficient experience.
